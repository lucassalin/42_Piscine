## 42 Piscine

The "Piscine" is the 42 school entrance examination.  

The Piscine is __accessible to all__:  

- No age limit (or almost: > 18 years old)  
- Free access  
- Possibility to sleep on-site for free (excluding covid)  
- No programming experience is required  

It can take place in the 42 different campuses of the network, spread over 5 continents. 

I have done my Piscine at the very first campus, in Paris.  

The entrance examination lasts 1 month and is divided into *several parts*:  

* Monday to Friday: __increasingly complex programming exercises__  
* Every Friday from 4 to 8 p.m: __exam__ (8 hours for the last).  
* From the end of the exam until Sunday evening: __group projects__.  

The first two days of the Piscine are command-line exercises, then all the other days are in C language.  

42 school is based on an innovative pedagogy: __peer-learning__.  

Without teachers or lessons, the candidates will interact together to advance throughout the Piscine.  

Once the day's project is finished, the candidates are corrected by two comrades, then by the school algorithm which has the final say.  

This algorithm, called the "Moulinette", is very rigorous and tries to break the code by all means.  
It also ensures compliance with the Norm.  

__42 Norm__ is a set of good practices relating to program syntax, inculcated from the start of the Piscine.  

In addition to learning the rigor required by the C language, this standard forces candidates to adopt good habits.  

Ecole 42 selects its future students according to two criteria: __the ability to learn__ and __solidarity__.  

And to make sure of solidarity side, each week the candidates will have to vote for 10 people who have helped them (called "The Voxotron").
